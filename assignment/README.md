# Assignments

Assignments is a utility that will allow you to seamlessly be up-to-date with the state of your assignments.

## Features 

Prints the assignments of your enrolled courses to the terminal. These are the following options available for convenience:

- **Inclusion of expired assignments**: usually there are expired assignments from previous years.
(default = false)

- **Include only favorite courses**: fetch only courses marked as 'favorites'. 
(default = false)

- **Exclusion of selected courses**: there are courses that do not have assignments.
(default = empty)

- **Exclusion of selected assignments**: professors tend to divide assignments in a non-common pattern like per lab classes.
(default = empty)

- **Export an ICS file**: produces a calendar file that can be imported from any calendar app. See [here](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37118?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop). 
(default = false)

- **Plain text**: The output will be printed in csv format instead of a table.
(default = false)
